Subject: Use /usr/sbin/service for service management on Debian

In Debian jessie systemd will be the default init system. But the old system V
and other alternative init systems are still supported. /usr/sbin/service
provides an abstraction layer which is able to start, stop and restart
services independent of the init system used.
