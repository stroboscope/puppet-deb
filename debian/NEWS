puppet (3.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=high

  The puppet agent is now started by default, regardless of init system.

    - On a fresh installation, you will need to run "puppet agent --enable"
      before it will connect to a puppet master to retrieve its catalog.

puppet (3.1.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  Puppet 3.x introduces incompatible changes.
  
  For the puppet DSL, dynamic variable scoping has been removed. This
  means that your manifests may need changes to work as intended. See
  http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/scope_and_puppet.html

  Authorization of clients in /etc/puppet/auth.conf now matches client
  certificate names only. There is a new allow_ip keyword in auth.conf if
  you want to permit IP addresses.

  For the full list of changes, see:
  http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Release_Notes#3.1.0
