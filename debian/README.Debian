puppet for Debian
------------------

To enable the puppet agent after installation, run

 "puppet agent --enable"

The default puppet configuration in Debian will automatically integrate with
etckeeper if etckeeper is installed. puppet will automatically commit any
changes made to files in /etc via etckeeper before and after its run.
